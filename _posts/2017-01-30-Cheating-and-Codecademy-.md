**Cheating and Codecademy**

In the lesson we carried on with codecademy and we carried going through the lessons on codecademy and someone in our class got caught telling a friend the correct bit of code. We got taught a lesson about this which was that you should never tell people the answer. This is because is doesn't help them learn because the point of learning is not to get the answer right but the process of getting to the answer. So if you tell someone the answer then they don't have to work it out themselves which means they miss out on a piece of learning. This is a bad thing because if they have a test on it they won't know how to do it.
