  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Some effective strategies were to test out how the arm worked and which code made the arm move which way and how to move it the way we wanted it too. This was effective because it let us learn how to work the robot arm effectively. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>At the start we couldn't get it to work until we realised that there was an on and off switch at the back of the arm so we got held up a little bit on that silly mistake and then we typed in a bit of code that made it move the wrong way and made a loud clicking noise so we had to turn it off and on again.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time we will know where the on and off switch is and we will try to work on which way to move the arm and when to move it. Hopefully we will work quicker and catch up on what we missed next week. </td>
