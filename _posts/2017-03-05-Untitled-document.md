**Editing My Blog**

In this lesson once again I made no progress from 23 percent complete. This is because in this lesson we were talking about our blogs and also we were talking about th and td. Th contain header information created with the th element. Td contains data created with the td element. We spent a bit of the lesson talking about that and then I had to fix and change my blog and that took up big chunk  of the lesson. And finally I am stuck on a really hard question so me trying to get past that really hard question took up the last bit of the lesson. Hopefully if there are no distractions to keep off working on codecademy then I might be able to reach 28 percent.
