    <td>Some effective strategies were to save our work after every piece of script and then at the end of the lesson save everything on to our memory sticks at the same time instead of stopping after every piece of script.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>We need to type quicker because we could have got through a couple more pages of the FUZE book if we had both typed the code faster into the computer. Also if we had read out the code needed to be typed into the computer quicker then we would have got further. Nevertheless we still got quite far into the book this week.</td>

    <td>We both need to practise on typing code in quicker and reading out our code from the FUZE book quicker. </td>
