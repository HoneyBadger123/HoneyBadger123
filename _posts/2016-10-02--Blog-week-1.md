    <td>I learnt by reading every part of the book and following the tutorials and making sure that I had mastered that section before moving on to the next part.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Setting up the FUZE box took a while and so I was a little bit behind and reading through everything slowly took too long. This limited my learning because I didn't get as much time as I should do to learn</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will go faster when reading through the book and try to set up the FUZE box faster and more effectively so I get the maximum amount of time to learn.</td>
