Prezi

Over the Easter Holidays we had an IT project to do a presentation, using Prezi, on the History of Computers. Today we had a look at a few of them to see the layouts and detail some people put in. some of them had some great facts but some quite funny spelling mistakes. Our homework is to take a look back at our Prezis and improve them.
