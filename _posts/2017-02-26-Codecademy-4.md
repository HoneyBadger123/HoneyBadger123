**Codecademy 4**

In this lesson I made no progress in percentage but I did a few problems. The reason I made no progress is because in the first bit of the lesson we were looking at our blogs and fixing them. Then I got stuck on a few really hard problems and tried really hard to do them and I did them eventually but it took a while. So I stayed at 23 percent this week unfortunately but I think if there are no problems next week then I could get to 28 percent.
