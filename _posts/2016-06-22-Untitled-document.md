**Media**I have learnt a lot about media like what different types of media there are like newspapers, cinemas, radios etc. I have also found out what adverts do to attract people, the different types of social media like Snapchat, Instagram and facebook.. I have also learnt what are the pros and cons of media like you can chat with your friends on various social medias, You can make your friends laugh but try not to be offensive. We have also learnt how to be safe on social media like: only letting people you know follow you, to stay safe when posting and not to talk with random strangers. In the last 2 weeks we have been talking about what makes your identity like what your hobbies are, what sports do you like, what subjects do you like at school and what your family are like etc.
