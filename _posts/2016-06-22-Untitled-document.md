**microbit**

Today in IT we did a coding lesson on the sorting hat in Harry Potter. We worked out how the sorting hat would work if it was on a computer. We made the computer randomly pickfour houses, which are; Gryfindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin. But for homework we had to that with our own houses in our school. Our houses are; Rayner, Pearson, Newman, Thorne, Foxell and Holeman. This Creates a sorting hat like code between the numbers 1-6 which are how many houses we have. So if it picks number 4 then it would be Newman, number 5= Pearson etc. When we start running the code it would spell out the word Newman, for example with little dots, if that's what was picked. This is on a website called microbit.
