Before our lesson today we had to hand in all our tutorials that we did on microbit. When it came to our lesson some of us, including me, didn't do our homework. I have some tips that our teacher told us when it comes to homework. Don't leave your homework till the last minute, make sure you know what you are doing and if you don’t ask the teacher or a friend. We have IT on a monday so if we leave it until to late there’s nothing we can do about not doing our homework. DON’T DO YOUR HOMEWORK THE NIGHT BEFORE THE LESSON!! After this we started to fix problems on our blog page and on google drive or start our microbit game.
