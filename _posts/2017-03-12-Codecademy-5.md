**Codecademy 5**

In this lesson we were on codecademy again and this time I got past that really hard question that I got stuck on last time and this allowed me to progress up to 28 percent. As you can see from the amount I have progressed in the amount of weeks I have been using codecademy how big the python course is. I still have so much to learn about python. I think that I have been not been progressing as well as other people because I have had many weeks where I had to edit and fix my blog. I think that next week I can get to 34 percent as long as there are no distractions with my blog or if we have to talk about something at the front of the the classroom. If we do have to go to the front or if I do have to edit my blog then I think I could get up to 31 percent if I do well.
