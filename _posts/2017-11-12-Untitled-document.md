**My Virtual Shop Blog**

In Mondays lesson, we created a google sheet called my virtual shop. The purpose of this sheet was to code a way to be able to just click on an item and the price would come up. So we would make different items to sell in a typical clothes store like a shirt and gave it a price. We would call one column 'stock' for our items and another ‘price’ for the price of it. Then we would skip a column and then call that column ‘item’, then we would call the next one ‘price’ then ‘quantity’ then ‘total’. Then we would add the stock into the items section and then use vlookup in the price section to find the price of that item. Then you can just manually add a quantity and for the total all you have to do is times the price by the quantity so all you have to put is the cell with the price and then a star symbol like this, *, and then the cell with the quantity in.
