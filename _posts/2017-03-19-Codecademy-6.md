**Codecademy 6**

In this lesson I made it up to 38 percent and I made great progress since the last 3 weeks. This is because for the last three weeks I was trying to speed through all of the questions and then didn't read the instructions properly so I was stuck on them. Last lesson I slowed down and read the instructions properly and progressed well. Next week I am going to make sure I try to read the instructions and go quickly at the same time. If I can learn to go quickly and read the instructions properly then I could progress really well. Also I will do some work on Codecademy at home as well so I can progress some more.
