    <td>We took it in turns again to read the script and type and the strategy is proving to be effective as we are getting through a lot of the book.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>If we had got all the equipment set up a lot quicker and if we collected everything we needed as quickly as everyone else we would have got more learning time. The computer also wouldn't turn on so we couldn't work for about 5 minutes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We made a silly mistake of not turning the FUZE box on at the back so we spent a bit of time trying to turn it on.</td>
