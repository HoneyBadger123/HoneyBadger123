Todays lesson

In today's lesson we talked about adverts, what is real and what is not. For example in the lesson we watched an advert for a tv show where overweight people have to lose as much weight as possible. There were many bits that were not real for example it said they only were allowed vegetables but that is not true because that is not good for them and the participants could sue them.
