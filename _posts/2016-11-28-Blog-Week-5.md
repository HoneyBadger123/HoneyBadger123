    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>We learnt by each typing and reading the book so no one person would spend the whole lesson reading the book or typing. We changed over after every finished piece of script.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited our learning was the time it took to save our work. It was really long because we had to save it on the computer and then on our memory sticks and that took quite a long time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time we will try to be quicker in saving our work and moving on to the next bit.</td>
