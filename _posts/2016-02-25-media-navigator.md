Media Navigator

Over the past few weeks we have been doing media navigator. Media navigator is us talking about what social media we will use, how to be safe on social media, what social media we use and other things to do with that. Most recently we did an identity map which is basically a mindmap of anything to do with our identity for example, religion or favourite sports. We went around the class writing down what we thought about it like you would do on social media. Most of the answers my friends put would be different on social media, so luckily no-one got deeply offended. It was different than commenting online because: 1. You might not know the person 2. In real life they might hit you or say something not very nice to you. 

My view of social media has changed since we talked about how to be safe. We talked about how people can be offensive or mean and make you upset. Which I, like most normal people wouldn't like to happen to me so when I get social media I wonâ€™t do it to other people and just talk to my friends.
