  <tr>
    <td>Effective strategies that we used were ones that enabled us to work quickly but helped as well. For example we took it in turns to type and read out the code to each other. This worked because otherwise one of us would eventually get tired of typing letters into the computer or tired of reading out code.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>We need to type quicker because we could have got through a couple more pages of the FUZE book if we had both typed the code faster into the computer. Nevertheless we still got quite far into the book this week.</td>

    <td>We both need to practise on typing quicker because that limited our learning.</td>
