**Buzzfeed**

In today's lesson we went on buzzfeed, a website based on social news and entertainment but it mostly has quizzes that you can do to test your knowledge on things or find out things like what is your mental age for example. We created a google document and made our own buzzfeed quiz and are thinking about how itâ€™s going to work. The buzzfeed quiz I did was about if you were any animal what would you be. I have made questions to ask and multiple choices of what you can answer with. For example would you be a mammal, fish, bird, reptile or amphibian. Next week we are going to be coding this on repl.it. In the past few weeks we have been using repl.it to do maths and ask us questions.
