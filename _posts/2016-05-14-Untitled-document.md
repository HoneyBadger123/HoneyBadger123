**Todays Lesson**

In today's lesson we looked at a website called microbit and followed the instructions and learnt how to code. Some of it was complicated but  most of it was fun, like most IT lessons we have.  There were 6 sets of instructions to follow we did a few in the lesson and the rest were set for homework.
