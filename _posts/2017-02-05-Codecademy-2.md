**Codecademy 3**

In today's lesson we did some more of codecademy on the python section and I got a lot further into the course. It is a very long course as over the time I've had which has been three one hour lessons I have only got 19% done. There are some really hard bits and some easier bits but  I think I was doing it as effective as I could. I think that this lesson I got stuck quite a bit on some of the questions but eventually I got through them. In this lesson I got up to 19% complete but I think I am able to reach up to 25% done next week. Also I will be doing some of codecademy at home to get a bit further towards my target for next lesson.
