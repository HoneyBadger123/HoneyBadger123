**Codecademy **

In this lesson we used a website called codecademy. On codecademy we learnt how to use python. This is a general purpose programming language. Codecademy helps people learn how to use different types of code for example python. There were lots of different sections in python to learn. I didn't finish all of them but I got through about half of the sections and it has really helped me learned python but I still have a lot more to learn.
