**Codecademy In and Out of lessons**

In today's lesson we were talking about how we should be doing Codecademy in and out of lessons. The reason behind this is so we can refresh our minds over the rest of the week, instead of just doing Codecademy once a week. Otherwise we might forget what we learnt the week before. This week we are making a diary and posting it on our blog on how much we do over the week. I will be doing 20 minutes every other day. 

Today on Codecademy I did the section called a day at thesupermarket, It was mainly quite easy apart from one exercise called making a purchase, this was hard because you had to define a function then in that function create a variable. Then for each item in the food list, add the price of that item to total. Then finally, return the total. This was quite a lot to do and sometimes I got the functions and variables mixed up so I was quite hard and confusing. Eventually I got it right though and now I am on 47 percent. Next time I will try to complete the section Student Becomes The Teacher.

On Codecademy today my goal was to complete the section student becomes the teacher. I didn't complete this because I got stuck on a question which I couldn’t get past. I"ll try to complete it next time I am on codecademy. It says I have an indentation error but I can’t find it. I will try to find it next time. All of the other exercises I did were not easy but not hard either, they were completable but they were a challenge.  

In today's session of codecademy I still couldn’t get past that exercise called sending a letter. The error message said "Oops try again, the function get_letter_grade is missing" even though it is there. I have been working on it for 20 minutes and I can’t find the problem. I was really confused about this and I will try to find out the problem in the lesson. Hopefully one of the people sitting next to me could help me as I am really confused about this.
