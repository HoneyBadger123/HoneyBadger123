**Learning**

In today's lesson we watched a video about not giving up. It had a child who was trying to vault a box but he couldn't, his teacher kept making him trying again even when he was crying. All his classmates were not laughing, but cheering him on. Eventually after 5 tries he made it and it is meant to show how you shouldn't give up and keep trying. This is the same in learning and not just at school, for example IT, if you get a bit of coding wrong you shouldn't just give up you should try again and again and again until you get it right. We learnt that learning isn't just a teacher telling you an answer, it is trying to work out something for yourself and it is trying over and over and over until you get it right.
