**Social Media**

Today in It we made a mindmap about ten good  ways you can use social media. We were in groups of three and we talked about it among us. After we did that we looked at a advert about a certain social media called Twitter. Some people on the advert were trying to convince this one lady to get it because they said anything you post is fine. The advert is saying that no one will comment badly on what you post, which is a lie.
